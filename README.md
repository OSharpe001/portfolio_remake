# Welcome to my Web Portfolio's Readme.
**Here, we'll discuss issues that I couldn't (yet) overcome, technologies used, a "User Story" and cap it all off with my stretch goals for this app. I'll also provide the link to my site, within.**

---

## App Description
**My portfolio app is the one-stop shop to check out my latest and greates creations. Here, you'll be able to get a quick view of my best apps and my resume, get all the juicy details of what technologies I utilized to create them, and even be able to visit the site and/or the GitHub repo!**

**I truly hope that you'll enjoy your time both here and testing out these apps!**

---

## Issues I couldn't resolve:

- **None, so far...**

---

## Technologies Used:

- React Router: Used to set up a multi-page-like app.
- React/JSX: A library that combines JavaScript and HTML functionality.
- JavaScript: Used to adapt interactivity to a web page, making it a "web application".
- HTML: The "document" section of a web page. Holds all the document's text.
- CSS: Used to apply styling to the web page document.
- **HONORABLE MENTIONS**
- JavaScript's "window" reference: Used to get info about what's happening in the browser's current window (like mouse location).

---

## Installation of Non-Standard Technologies:

- React: created app template by typing "npx create-react-app ." in the terminal for my project's folder.

- React Router: type "npm i react-router-dom" in my project's terminal.

## User Story:

1. As a user, I expect there to be a simple and intuitive user interface.

2. As a user, I expect to be taken to the section that showcases the web apps when I press the "Projects" link in the navbar.

3. As a user, I expect to be taken to the section with the contact form when I press the "Contact Me" link in the navbar.

4. As a user, I expect to be taken to the creator's resume when I press the "Resume" link in the navbar.

5. As a user, I expect to be taken to the creator's GitHub page when I press the Github icon in the navbar.

6. As a user, I expect to be taken to the creator's LinkedIn profile when I press the LinkedIn icon in the navbar.

7. As a user, I expect to be taken to the creator's Twitter ("X") profile page when I press the Twitter icon in the navbar.

8. As a user, I expect to be taken to the creator's StackOverflow
profile when I press the StackOverflow icon in the navbar.

9. As a user, I expect my computer's email browser to appear with a blank slate, ready to send a message to the portfolio's creator when I press the mail icon in the navbar.

10. As a user I expect, once I fully fill out the "contact Me" form and press the "Set Up Email" button, that my computer's email browser will appear with a (basically) finished email, ready to send to the portfolio's creator.

11. As a user, I expect not to be able to send an email from the "Contact Me" form if the form isn't completely filled out.

12. As a user, I expect to see intuitive and easily distinguishable error messages after trying to send an email using the "Contact Me" form if I incorrectly/incompletely filled out the form before pressing the "Set Up Email" button.

13. As a user, I expect to be taken to a project's Details Page when I press the project's picture in the Featured Projects section.

14. As a user, I expect to be taken to the project's live site when I press the "Visit Site" button on a particular project's card.

---

## Stretch Goals:

1. **Make app responsive for mobile.**

2. **Make my Featured Projects section a slideshow-like format.**

3. **Change my profile picture into a button that will bring users to the "About Me" page.**

4. **Fix the project pictures' buttons so that they will bring me to a fleshed-out Project Details page for each particular project.**
